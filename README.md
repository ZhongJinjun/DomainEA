# sub-dataset for DomainEA

This dataset is a sub-dataset of the DomainEA dataset and was constructed utilizing the Ta-da-recipe dataset, which originates from the Data Science and Knowledge Engineering Laboratory of Zhengzhou University of Light Industry. This sub-dataset is composed of two Chinese recipe websites, represented by tableA and tableB, respectively. The former consists of seven properties, namely id, name, mainFood, subFood, skill, taste, and difficulty, while the latter contains eight properties, namely id, name, mainFood, subFood, skill, taste, difficulty, and time. It is worth noting that no additional attributes were included in this experiment, as only those aforementioned are deemed applicable. If interested, you may access the entire Ta-da-recipe dataset at https://github.com/Eimo-Bai/Ta-da-recipe-dataset, which were constructed by our team members.
